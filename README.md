What is this project?
    - This project is the classic FizzBuzz problem that trips up many comp sci interviewees.

    - The program prints out every number from 1-100 

    - If the number is divisible by 3, the program will print out Fizz

     - If the number is divisible by 5, the program will print out Buzz

     -- If the number is divisible by 3 AND 5, the program will print out FizzBuzz
